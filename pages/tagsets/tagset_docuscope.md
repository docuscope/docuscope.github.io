## DocuScope

DocuScope is a dictionary-based tagger, developed by [David Kaufer and Suguru Ishizaki](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/computer-aided-rhetorical-analysis/61054) at Carnegie Mellon University.\n It consists of an enormous lexicon organized into a 3-level taxonomy.  An analogue would be the [lexicons typically used in sentiment analysis](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html).  Those usually organize words and phrases into 2 categories (positive and negative) and work by matching strings over a corpus of texts.\n DocuScope works in the same basic way, but organizes its strings into many more categories and is orders of magnitude larger. A typical sentiment lexicon may match 3-5 thousand strings.  DocuScope matches 100s of millions. You can find a small, early version of the dictionary [here](https://github.com/docuscope/DocuScope-Dictionary-June-26-2012).
